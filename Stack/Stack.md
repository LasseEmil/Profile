# Stack Directory

This folder stores external tooling/dependencies needed during development.

- `Cpython/`: local Python virtual environment (activate with `source Stack/Cpython/bin/activate`).

If additional stacks are introduced (Node, Rust, etc.), create subfolders here and document them following the same `DirName/DirName.md` pattern.
